<p>1: My build was a casino that had multipule games including craps, blackjack, slots, and Roulette</p>
<p></p>
<p>2: I used HTML and Java Script</p>
<p></p>
<p>3: I used Windsurf to make the base code and I found and changed what I wanted and told it if there were any errors it needed to fix</p>
<p></p>
<p>4: The AI wrote the base code and I went in and changed everything to my preferences and located errors that were in the code</p>
<p></p>
<p>5: One thing I'm proud of is the craps table and all the features that were added for the betting</p>
<p></p>
<p>6: With more time I would have liked to add more features to the blackjack game</p>
